# Weather Modeling using Quadratic Equation  (Waterfall Model)

## 1. Waterfall Model
The Waterfall model is **linear and sequential**. Each phase is completed before moving to the next.

###  Phases:
1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Inputs: coefficients `a, b, c` and `time t`
   - Output: Predicted temperature `T`
2. **System Design**
   - Formula: T(t) = a*tÂ² + b*t + c
   - Simple function-based Python design
3. **Implementation**
   - Python code written to calculate temperature
4. **Testing**
   - Use different coefficients
   - Test boundary values (e.g., t = 0, t = 24)
5. **Deployment**
   - Run program on different systems
   - Collect feedback
6. **Maintenance**
   - Fix bugs
   - Improve usability (e.g., better inputs, error handling)

###  Pros:
- Clear, simple steps  
- Best for small projects  

### Cons:
- No flexibility if requirements change later
